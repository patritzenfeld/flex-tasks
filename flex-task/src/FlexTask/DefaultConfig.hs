dTaskData :: String

{-
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Module for generating static task data, possibly randomized.
This includes (in order):

- Flexible data available to both the task description and the checks/feedback. (String)
- The entire "Check" module, containing a syntax and a semantics check. (String, use QuasiQuoting)
- An HTML input form represented by the names of all contained input fields and HTML code,
  wrapped in IO. (IO ([String],String))

Provide a function
getTask :: Gen (String, String, IO ([String],String))
implementing a generator for these elements.

If no specific form is required, you may use 'formify' to generate a generic form for you,
based on the type of your input.
Derive Generic for your solution type and add an instance of Formify without a body. The expression

formify {OPTIONAL DEFAULT VALUE(S) OR Nothing} STRUCTURE

will then generate a form with synchronised field names.
See the 'FlexTask.Generic.Form' documentation for more information.

You can also create custom forms, if something more sophisticated is required.
The forms are normal Yesod MForms that are wrapped in a Reader Monad.
The Reader models the insertion of a security HTML fragment for POST and GET forms
that is automatically performed when rendering the form.

To write your own form, simply design an MForm first, as described in the Yesod book.
Then replace the returned FormResult with a list of field names.
Make sure that the field names match the names used in the actual form.
Finally, run the form in the reader Monad using the following expression (import 'reader' from 'Control.Monad.Reader'):

reader $ \frag -> YOURFORM

and interpolate the HTML argument at the top of the contained widget:

...
#{frag}
...

You can compose multiple forms using the '$$>' infix function.
This will mostly be necessary when using a generated form together with a custom one.
Apply 'getFormData' to your finished form to obtain the data for the generator.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Use this function to create the 'Check' module.
The entire module is first created as a String.
It will later be written to file as an actual module.
This module must contain two functions:

checkSyntax :: OutputCapable m => StoredDataType -> FilePath -> SolutionType -> LangM m

checkSemantics :: OutputCapable m => StoredDataType -> FilePath -> SolutionType -> Rated m

StoredDataType is the actual type of the flexible data generated above.
It is stored in the task instance and passed to both check functions.
Used to store variable data affected by random generation.
SolutionType is the actual type of the student submission after parsing.
The FilePath argument is the server path for storing and loading images and other data.
It is supplied by the caller of the checker functions and can be used as is, if file creation is required.
The type signature must also be adjusted in this case.
A 'MonadIO m' constraint must be set for file operations to work (including an import of the type class).
Otherwise, the FilePath argument can be completely ignored.

The functions' result types are taken from 'Control.OutputCapable.Blocks'.
They model a type-independent representation of checks and corresponding feedback.
Refer to the libraries' documentation for help.
LangM is feedback without a score.
Rated is feedback with a final score as a fraction, i.e. 0 to 1.

As this function produces a String, you can also use interpolation.
Use to precompute data and interpolate the results directly into the module.
This is most useful for static data, that is not affected by random generation, and expensive calculations.
Note that slashes must be escaped.
I.e. when introducing an anonymous function, write
'\\x -> ...' instead of '\x -> ...' to avoid compile failure.

checkSyntax will always run first.
If it does not succeed, then checkSemantics will not be evaluated for the submission.
checkSemantics is only run if checkSyntax finished successfully,
i.e. no syntax error was found in the given solution.

dParse :: String
dParse = [rQ|

{-
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Module for parsing the student submission.
Must contain the function

parseSubmission :: String -> Either ParseError Solution

where the given String is the submission.
The parsers used are those of 'Text.Parsec'.
Refer to its documentation if necessary.

As with forms, a generic parser interface is available.
The steps are similar:
Derive Generic for your data type and include an instance declaration of 'Parse' without an implementation.
It is also possible to write your own, using standard Parsec functions.
The submission has a specific encoding, which is already taken into account by automatically generated parsers.
When using a custom parser, you need to include the encoding or your parser will fail.
The 'escaped' function from 'FlexTask.Generic.Parse' takes a parser and reads the encoding around it.
This ensures that your custom parser will work as expected.

If your submission type consists of types with generic parsers, as well as custom parsers,
do not write a custom parser for the whole type.
Instead, use bodyless instances for the component types where possible
and use custom parsers for those where not applicable.
Finally, use the bodyless instance method for the entire type.
This is again necessary to avoid encoding problems that are caused internally by argument delimiters.

To implement parseSubmission, you can use the 'useParser' function, again supplied by 'FlexTask.Generic.Parse'.
It only takes your parser as an argument.
